# Sphragis — Active Implementation Log

Rolling notes on in-flight work. See `ROADMAP.md` for the stable plan.

## Current focus

### Repo split from phalanx-fl (2026-09-13)

The corpus and measurement code was built inside `phalanx-fl` and moved here. It had grown to
80% of that repo's test suite while importing exactly one function from it, in a repo whose
stated purpose is a Flower testbed.

The decisive argument was not tidiness but a policy conflict: phalanx's roadmap carries a
recurring invariant to ride the latest Flower release, and a paper artifact needs the opposite.
Those are contradictory release policies sharing one lockfile, already visible in Dependabot
alerts pinned by `flwr` on a repo whose paper code never imported `flwr`.

`phalanx.corpus` became `sphragis.corpus`, plan B's three modules became `sphragis.measure`,
and `provenance_header` was copied rather than imported.

### Next: plan A2, stage bodies

Wire `fetch`, `build`, `dedup`, `split` and `freeze` to real artifacts under
`datasets/gerrit/<org>/`.

Everything else is unblocked: `gerrit.fetch_changes` takes a transport seam, so the stage
bodies can be built and tested against recorded fixtures before any live collection.

### Corpus yield, measured on live OpenStack data (2026-09-14)

The first real fetch. Numbers the Stage 1 report's sampling section needs, and which no
amount of reading the API docs would have produced.

| | |
|---|---|
| merged post-cutoff changes sampled | 35 |
| with a comment on a code file | 8 (23%) |
| comments examined | 15 |
| anchored **inside** a changed hunk | 4 (27%) |
| within 10 lines of a changed hunk | 10 cumulative (67%) |
| comment on the final patch set, no successor | see note |

**Correction (same session).** The first run counted 4 of 15 comments as "diff errors" and
I attributed them to comments on the final patch set. That attribution was never verified:
the diagnostic run died on a transient network failure, and a clean re-run of 9 comments
found 1 on a final patch set, 8 diffs fetched fine, and **zero** genuine diff errors. So the
final-patch-set condition is real and confirmed, the rate is not established, and some of
the original 4 were probably network flakes rather than data. `has_successor_revision` is
correct either way; the number attached to it was not.

**The anchoring rule is now a pre-registration decision with a measured cost.** The spec
says a comment must fall inside a changed hunk between patch set n and n+1. That is the
defensible rule, because the edit plausibly addresses the comment, and it keeps 27% of
comments. Widening to a 10-line neighbourhood keeps 67%, roughly 2.5x the data, at the
cost of a weaker link between the comment and the edit.

Recommendation: keep strict as primary and report the widened number as the sensitivity a
reviewer will ask for. Widen only if the pilot power analysis says the strict corpus is too
small, so the decision is driven by the minimum detectable effect rather than convenience.

Rough projection at the strict rule: OpenStack's 2,350 merged changes in October 2024 imply
on the order of a few hundred examples per month. Verify against a real month before the
report quotes anything.

### Two API facts the code was wrong about, both found by fetching

- **The change payload carries no file content.** `o=ALL_FILES` returns only metadata
  (`lines_deleted`, `old_sha`, `size_delta`). Hunks now come from Gerrit's own diff
  endpoint, which also keeps hunk boundaries identical to what the reviewer saw.
- **`after:` filters on last update, not creation.** `after:2024-10-01 before:2024-10-03`
  returned a change created 2024-08-26. The post-cutoff contamination argument rests on
  creation date, so `created_on_or_after` enforces it client-side.
