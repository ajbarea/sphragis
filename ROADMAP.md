# Sphragis — Roadmap

Sphragis tests whether an organization leaves a learnable fingerprint in the code it reviews,
and what a declared boundary protects once it can. It is the apparatus for the Federated Agents
research direction: RQ1 is a go/no-go gate, RQ2 the leakage study that follows it.

**Design of record:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-gerrit-review-corpus-harness-design.md`
**Deadline that sets the order:** MSR 2027 Registered Reports Stage 1, **2026-11-20**.
The pre-submission checklist lives in the `papers` repo at `org-fingerprint/STAGE1-SKELETON.md`.

## Plan A — corpus construction

- [x] `scrub` — salted pseudonyms, identity fields nulled, emails swept from free text.
- [x] `manifest` — per-window counts and content hashes over a shared provenance header.
- [x] `gerrit` — XSSI prefix, cursor paging, `Retry-After`, client errors not retried.
- [x] `examples` — changed hunks, comments anchored by line range, unanchored hunks dropped.
- [x] `dedup` — exact, near-duplicate, repeated-boilerplate.
- [x] `split` — changes assigned whole to windows; the test window sealed, not collected.
- [x] `cli` — stage dispatch.
- [ ] **Plan A2 — stage bodies.** Wire the stages to real artifacts.
- **The test window is sealed.** It is defined and hashed at Stage 1 and fetched only after
  in-principle acceptance, so fetch timestamps are the Stage 2 evidence that collection
  followed acceptance.
- **One binding metric.** Exact match decides the gate. Normalized EM and edit similarity are
  reported and are not part of the pass rule. LLM-as-judge is excluded from both.
- **The measurement runs without a GPU.**
- **Dependencies are pinned.** A paper artifact has to reproduce years from now.

## Relationship to the other repos

Sphragis is the Federated Agents apparatus. It does not vendor the others.

| Repo | Relationship |
|---|---|
| `phalanx-fl` | RQ2 federates adapters on its Flower stack. Not a dependency yet; decided when RQ2 starts. |
| `velocity-fl` | Aggregation kernel and Byzantine arena for RQ2. |
| `pharos` | The disclosure-measurement methodology this study reuses on real rather than generated data. Cited. |
| `papers` | `org-fingerprint/` holds the Stage 1 report. LINEAGE row P4. |

`provenance.py` is copied from phalanx-fl, not imported. Twelve lines of standard library is
the wrong thing to take a cross-repo dependency for, especially on a repo whose stated
invariant is to ride the latest Flower while this one must stay reproducible.
